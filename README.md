# Cycloid Motion Simulation

## Project Overview

The Cycloid Motion Simulation is a web application built with Flask that allows users to visualize the motion of a cycloid. Users can specify parameters such as the radius and maximum time to compute and display the position, velocity, and acceleration of a point on a cycloid curve.

## Installation

To set up the Cycloid Motion Simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cycloid-motion-simulation.git
   cd cycloid-motion-simulation
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. **Interact with the simulation**:
   Use the provided interface to adjust the radius (R), maximum time (t_max), and the number of steps to compute the positions, velocities, and accelerations of the cycloid.

## Features

- Calculate and visualize the position of a point along a cycloid based on user-defined parameters.
- Provide real-time computation of the cycloid's velocity and acceleration.
- User-friendly web interface for entering parameters.

## Dependencies

The following packages are required to run this application:

- Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- NumPy: A fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.

Dependencies can be installed using the command:
```bash
pip install Flask numpy
```

Note: You can also create a `requirements.txt` file and add the dependencies there to facilitate installation.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
/cycloid-motion-simulation
│
├── app.py               # Main application file
└── templates
    └── index.html      # HTML template for the web interface
```

- **app.py**: Contains the Flask application and routes for serving the web pages and API endpoints.
- **templates/index.html**: The HTML template that serves as the user interface for the simulation.
